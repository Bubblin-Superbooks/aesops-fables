way.  At last he came to a part of the road where the wheels sank
half-way into the mire, and the more the horses pulled, the deeper
sank the wheels.  So the Waggoner threw down his whip, and knelt
down and prayed to Hercules the Strong.  "O Hercules, help me in
this my hour of distress," quoth he.  But Hercules appeared to
him, and said:</p><p>"Tut, man, don't sprawl there.  Get up and put your shoulder
to the wheel."</p></div> </div>
