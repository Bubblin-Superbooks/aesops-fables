meet a House-dog who was passing by.  "Ah, Cousin," said the Dog.
"I knew how it would be; your irregular life will soon be the ruin
of you.  Why do you not work steadily as I do, and get your food
regularly given to you?"</p><p>"I would have no objection," said the Wolf, "if I could only
get a place."</p><p>"I will easily arrange that for you," said the Dog; "come with
me to my master and you shall share my work."</p></div> </div>
