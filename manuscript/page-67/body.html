chirping and singing to its heart's content.  An Ant passed by,
bearing along with great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the
nest.</p><p>"Why not come and chat with me," said the Grasshopper,
"instead of toiling and moiling in that way?"</p><p>"I am helping to lay up food for the winter," said the Ant,
"and recommend you to do the same."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Why bother about winter?" said the Grasshopper;</p></div> </div>
